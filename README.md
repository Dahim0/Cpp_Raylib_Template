# Cpp_Raylib_Template
This is a clean and easy Cpp raylib template for anyone who wanna get started fast.
Here are the step you should follow for the code to work:

1) in a terminal type this to clone this template:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dahim0/Cpp_Raylib_Template/edit/main/README.md [Your porject name here]
```
2) Then to build the project:
```
./build.sh
```
3) And now to run the project:
```
./app
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are on Vs Code just press [Ctrl][Shift][B] to skip step 1 and 2 .
> 
> If not you should delete the .vscode file because it is not necessary for the project.

4) Finally you can delete the Git file too because it is not usefull for the project.


Now here is a little list of each file and what they do:
## main.cpp
This is where you will write your code you can have other code file to write your code in but the game wont work without a main.cpp file
## build.sh
this is a shell file with 6 command so instead of typing these 5 command each time to build your code you just use the build.sh file and it will do the 6 commands for you!
## app
This is what the build.sh will make, it is an executuable that run the game.
